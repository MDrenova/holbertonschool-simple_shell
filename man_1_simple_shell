.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a very basic shell that reads a command from standard input and executes it. It does not handle all the features of a typical shell. It is a starting point for building a more complex shell.
.PP
The shell displays a prompt, waits for the user to type a command, and executes it. If the command cannot be executed, it prints an error message. It also handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
.SH USAGE
Start the shell by running:
.IP
.B ./simple_shell
.PP
Type a command at the prompt and press Enter to execute it.
.SH EXAMPLES
Start the shell:
.IP
.B ./simple_shell
.PP
At the prompt, type a command:
.IP
.B /bin/ls
.PP
The shell will execute the command and display the output.
